      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a happy husband and proud father of two wonderful kids. I have an Associates Degree in Advertising and Graphic Design and I am currently working on finishing a FullStack Coding Bootcamp Certificate. I look forward to finally get into a career as a Software Developer. It's been something that I have wanted to do for many years. I plan to have this as my career for the rest of my life. I've always enjoyed learning how things work and I have always been really good with technology. I am used to working in fast pace environments and I learn very quickly. I strive to do my absolute best at everything I do and always give 150% effort. I am currently looking for a company that I can grow with and hope to one day be their lead developer.
